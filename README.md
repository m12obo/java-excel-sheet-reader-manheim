# Java-Excel-Sheet-Reader-Manheim
A Java program to import an Excel spreadsheet and using the GUI print off the data required by each inspector

Reason : A very large spreadsheet was distributed to each inspector and I had to manually search to find each job and
         and create a worksheet for the next day. I created this to make the job semi automated.
         
Languages : Java.

Libraries : java.awt, javax.swing , org.apache.poi.hssf, org.apache.poi.ss.

Notes     : This was one of the first programs that I attempted after learning to program Java it involved a lot of research                on google to get this to work as I wanted it to, it did improve my java skills greatly and was a great way to                  learn although it does contain a few bugs.
